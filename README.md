note: there is no exe version for now, please use animekizigercekmi.py to play the game. all copyrights belong to me. you need to download python 3.8 to play this game and you need a code editor to run it. you will be able to play it without downloading any other things when i upload the exe version. i'll be debugging and redesigning the game for a better experience. also currently there are both english and turkish language options.
