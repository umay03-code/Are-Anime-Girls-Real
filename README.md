# are anime girls real?

Step into the world of Ottoman with Osman, as he battles enemies to prove that anime girls are real in this exciting game! Join him on his quest to victory and experience the true power of Ottoman and anime girls.

While the exe version is still in development, you can still play the game using animekizigercekmi.py. As the sole owner of the copyrights, I assure you of a thrilling experience. To play the game, you'll need to download Python 3.8 and use a code editor. I'm currently working on debugging and redesigning the game for an even better experience. The game is available in both English and Turkish languages. Stay tuned for more updates!
